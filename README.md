### Minerals type
* muscovite: is a hydrated phyllosilicate mineral of aluminium and potassium with formula KAl2(AlSi3O10)(F,OH)2, or (KF)2(Al2O3)3(SiO2)6(H2O). Muscovite is the most common mica, found in granites, pegmatites, gneisses, and schists, and as a contact metamorphic rock or as a secondary mineral resulting from the alteration of topaz, feldspar, kyanite.
* chrysocolla: is a hydrated copper phyllosilicate mineral with formula: Cu2−xAlx(H2−xSi2O5)(OH)4·nH2O (x<1)[1] or (Cu,Al)2H2Si2O5(OH)4·nH2O. Associated minerals are quartz, limonite, azurite, malachite, cuprite, and other secondary copper minerals.
* quartz: is a hard, crystalline mineral composed of silicon and oxygen atoms. Quartz is a defining constituent of granite and other felsic igneous rocks. It is very common in sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and shale. It is a common constituent of schist, gneiss, quartzite and other metamorphic rocks.
* bornite: is a sulfide mineral with chemical composition Cu5FeS4. Bornite is an important copper ore mineral and occurs widely in porphyry copper deposits along with the more common chalcopyrite.
pyrite: is an iron sulfide with the chemical formula FeS2 (iron(II) disulfide).
* malachite: is a copper carbonate hydroxide mineral, with the formula Cu2CO3 (OH)2. Malachite often results from the weathering of copper ores, and is often found with azurite (Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2), goethite, and calcite.
* biotite: Biotite is a common group of phyllosilicate minerals within the mica group with the approximate chemical formula K(Mg,Fe)3AlSi3O10(F,OH)2.
